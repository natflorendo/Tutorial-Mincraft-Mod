to see all minecraft recipes:


External Libraries < Gradle: net.minecraft:client:extra:1.20.6
< data < minecraft < recipes


Right now we don't know tag, so if you see a recipe with a tag,
just change it to item with your mod item instead

discovered item tag for result doesn't work in 1.20.6 (you have to use id instead)
